# [Mike Zanercik's Portfolio](https://mikezanercik.github.io/)
My portfolio is designed to display some of my work in a simple and clean format. The work included in this portfolio range from simple to complex as I continue to learn and develop my technical skills and learn new programming languages. 

Included on this site are links to the deployed applications as well as links to the GitHub repositories for those of you who wish to look further into these projects.

## Overview
* The entire portfolio is made up of one page to create a simplistic and user friendly way of displaying my work. The user first is greeted with a simple message and brief overview of who I am, what I do, and how to get in touch with me.

* As the user scrolls down on the page they see the various project and other works I have included in this portfolio. I wanted to display my work in a simple and aestheticly pleasing way that can be enjoyed by someone of any level of technical knowledge or experience.
